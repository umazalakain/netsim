\section{Design overview}

\textit{Netsim} is a Haskell package made of a library containing all the logic
(\texttt{src/Language/Netsim.hs}) and an executable interface using that library
(\texttt{src/Main.hs}).

Instead of declaring new types, the library makes an extensive use of type
synonyms. Type synonyms are viewed as equivalent by the type-checker, but are
useful to convey information.

All information is contained within three types. All three types are indexed
first by a \textit{source} node and then by a \textit{destination} node: they
represent information regarding a relation $A \rightarrow B$.

\begin{description}
    \item [\texttt{Network}] constains the cost of every direct link from $A$ to
        $B$: static information about the network's toponomy. This information
        remains unchanged during periodic exchanges -- unless the user changes
        it to simulate broken links or cost changes.
        
        The function \texttt{bidir} is used to create undirected networks, where
        $A \rightarrow B \iff B \rightarrow A$. This is done by taking the union
        of the given network and its swapped copy -- where $A \rightarrow B
        \rightarrow cost$ gets transformed into $B \rightarrow A \rightarrow
        cost$.

    \item [\texttt{State}] contains the cost of the best route from $A$ to $B$
        together with the gateway for such route: all the runtime state. The
        gateway of a node must be directly linked to that node. 

    \item [\texttt{Ads}] contains advertisment messages sent from $A$ to $B$.
        These messages the periodic exchanges in the network. They contain
        distance vectors -- $destination \rightarrow cost$ maps.
\end{description}

On each \textit{tick} of the network, nodes first create advertisements
(containing a source, a destination and a distance vector) and then update their
tables with advertisements sent to them. Stale broken links are cleared from
routing tables. Distance vectors created as part of route advertisement messages
can have split-horizon toggled.

All features related to execution are found in \texttt{src/Main.hs}. Networks
are declared by the user through a simple syntax and then parsed. If the
\texttt{-d} switch is present, links will be considered directed, otherwise
they will be made bidirectional. Finally, the user is presented with a simple
shell where the main functionality is offered: running the simulation, querying
the state, modifying the underlying network, activating split-horizon.

\section{User manual}

\textbf{Note}: an executable capable of running on Windows 10 x64 could not be
provided, as cross-compilation in Haskell can be tricky and the author does not
have a Windows 10 x64 machine.

This project is written in Haskell and uses Cabal to build itself. Both can be
installed by following the steps found at
\url{https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html}. 

\subsection{Compilation}

Assuming a shell with the project's directory as the current directory, the
project can be built as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    # Updates the list of packages available online
    cabal update
    # Installs dependencies
    cabal install --dependencies-only
    # Builds the project
    cabal build
\end{verbatim}

The resulting binary will be found in \texttt{dist/build/netsim/netsim}.

\subsection{Installation}

Assuming a shell with the project's directory as the current directory, the
project can be installed as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    # Updates the list of packages available online
    # Only necessary the first time
    cabal update
    # Install the project and its dependencies
    cabal install
\end{verbatim}

The generated output will specify the location of the generated binary. The
shell's path list should point to the directory in which the binary resides, in
which case it will be executable by running \texttt{netsim}.

\subsection{Execution}

Executing netsim without any arguments will output a brief help text. Netsim
expects a network file as its first argument. Unless netsim is ran without the
\texttt{-d} switch, network links are undirected.

Network files must have one link declaration per line (should support Windows'
carriage returns). Let \texttt{<SOURCE>} and \texttt{<DESTINATION>} be arbitrary
identifiers with no space in them, and let \texttt{<COST>} be an integer, then a
link is declared as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
<SOURCE> <DESTINATION> <COST>
\end{verbatim}

Once a network file is successfully parsed, netsim will present an interactive
shell. Unrecognised commands will result in help text being printed. The list of
commands follows:
