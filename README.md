A report containing an informal overview of the application, a short user
manual, example walkthroughs, and a status report can be found in
`report/report.pdf`.

The source code for the application can be found in `src`. `src/Main.hs`
contains all functionality related to the command line interface.
`src/Language/Netsim.hs` comtains all application logic.

A binary suitable to be ran on Windows 10 x64 could not be provided: the author
has no such machines, and crosscompilation in Haskell is tricky. The user manual
contains instructions on how to build this project on Windows 10 x64 machines.

Descriptions of example networks can be found in the `examples` directory.
